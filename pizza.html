    <h2>About Pizza</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a universally loved dish that originated in Italy and has become a global favorite. It consists of a flatbread base, typically topped with tomato sauce, melted cheese, and a variety of toppings such as pepperoni, vegetables, or seafood. The crust can range from thin and crispy to thick and fluffy, catering to different regional preferences. Its versatility allows endless customization, making it a dish for every taste and occasion.</p>
    <p>Traditionally baked in wood-fired ovens, modern pizzas are prepared using various methods, from home ovens to fast-food chains' innovative techniques. Classics like Margherita, with its simple combination of fresh basil, mozzarella, and tomato sauce, celebrate the essence of Italian cuisine, while international variations like deep-dish Chicago pizza and stuffed crusts highlight pizza's evolving creativity. Whether served as a casual snack or a gourmet meal, pizza continues to bring people together with its irresistible combination of flavors and textures.
