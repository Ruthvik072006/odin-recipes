    <h2>About Chicken biriyani</h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a deliciously spiced rice dish where tender chicken pieces are layered with aromatic basmati rice and cooked to perfection. The process begins by marinating chicken in yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and a touch of lemon juice for flavor and tenderness. Separately, basmati rice is parboiled with whole spices like cardamom, cloves, and bay leaves to enhance its aroma.</p>
    <p>In a large pot, the marinated chicken is sautéed with onions, tomatoes, and spices until cooked halfway. Partially cooked rice is layered over the chicken, and the dish is topped with saffron-infused milk, fried onions, fresh mint, and cilantro. The pot is sealed tightly to trap steam and cooked on low heat (dum method), allowing the chicken to absorb the spices and the rice to soak up the flavorful juices. Served hot with raita or salad, chicken biryani is a perfect blend of spices, texture, and aroma.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Chicken:
            In a large bowl, mix chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight for better flavor).</li>
        <li>Prepare the Rice:
            Rinse basmati rice thoroughly and soak it for 30 minutes. Boil water with whole spices (bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and peppercorns) and salt. Add the soaked rice and cook until it’s 70% done (still firm). Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Fry Onions:
            Heat ghee or oil in a pan and fry sliced onions until golden brown and crispy. Remove and set aside for garnish.</li>
        <li>Cook the Chicken:
            In a heavy-bottomed pot or deep pan, heat ghee/oil. Add the marinated chicken and cook for 10–12 minutes until the chicken is partially cooked. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.</li>
        <li>Layer the Biryani:
            Lower the heat and layer the partially cooked chicken at the bottom of the pot. Spread half of the parboiled rice over the chicken. Sprinkle fried onions, chopped mint, and cilantro on top. Repeat with another layer of rice, and add more onions, mint, and cilantro.</li>
        <li>Add Saffron and Final Touches:
            Warm a few tablespoons of milk and dissolve saffron strands in it. Drizzle the saffron milk over the top rice layer. Optionally, drizzle some ghee for extra richness.</li>
        <li>Seal and Cook (Dum Method):
            Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. If needed, seal the edges with dough or a damp kitchen towel to trap the steam. Cook on very low heat for 20–30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook.</li>
        <li>Serve:
            Gently mix the layers before serving to combine the flavors. Serve hot with raita (spiced yogurt) or a fresh salad on the side.</li>
    </ol>
